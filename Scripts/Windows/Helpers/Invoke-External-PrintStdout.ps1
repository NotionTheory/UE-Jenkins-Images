# Helper function for invoking an external utility (executable).
# The raison d'Ãªtre for this function is to allow 
# calls to external executables via their *full paths* to be mocked in Pester.

function Invoke-External-PrintStdout {

	<#
		.SYNOPSIS
		Runs an external program, in a mock-friendly way

    .DESCRIPTION
    This runs a console command. It will not work well with non-console applications.
    Standard Input is fed in from the Stdin parameter.
    Standard Output and Standard Error are both written to the console.
    Error messages will sometimes be formatted as this, and printed in red, first message being expanded:
      <commandname> : <message>
        + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (<message>  :String) [], RemoteException
        + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NativeCommandError 
      ... but further stderr prints will be just the messages themselves...
      ... and sometimes the error messages will be printed just as the message itself.
    Stdout and stderr will be interleaved in the order that the application prints to them.
