#  versions we use. This script accomplishes that.

# Run jenkins-plugin-cli and retrieve a full list of plugins including dependencies
#
# Note that we do not specify `--latest false` when invoking jenkins-plugin-cli.
# This is because the '--latest false' logic will not update dependencies:
#  if there first is a dependency a -> b (v1.2) -> c (v1.1),
#  and later on a dependency d -> b (v1.3) -> c (v1.2),
#  then the `--latest false` output will record c at v1.1 (and ignore that there is a v1.2 dependency)
#  and therefore the flattened output will be inconsistent.
#
# To work around this, we expect that plugins.txt contents have been bumped recently,
#  and freeze all plugin versions at what is currently latest.
